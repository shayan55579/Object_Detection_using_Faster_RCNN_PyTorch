# Object_Detection_using_Faster_RCNN_PyTorch
Object detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and localizing objects within an image or a video. Faster R-CNN is a popular object detection algorithm that uses a region proposal network (RPN) to generate object proposals and a classifier to classify the proposals and refine their bounding boxes.

PyTorch is a popular deep learning framework that provides an efficient way to implement and train neural networks.

Object detection using Faster R-CNN in PyTorch involves several steps including:

Preparing the dataset by annotating the images with object bounding boxes and labels.
Preprocessing the dataset by resizing and normalizing the images.
Defining the Faster R-CNN model architecture using PyTorch.
Training the model on the annotated dataset using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or another optimizer.
Evaluating the trained model on a test set to measure its performance.
Using the trained model to detect objects in new images or videos.
Faster R-CNN in PyTorch provides a powerful and flexible framework for object detection, allowing researchers and practitioners to customize the model architecture and training process to suit their specific needs.
